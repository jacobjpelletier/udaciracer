# Udaciracer game by Jacob Pelletier

## Project Introduction

Here is a partially built-out game that races cars—your job is to complete it! Throughout the game logic, _"TODO"_ items where completed to complete game functionality.

The game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins, and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)

3. The race results view

## Starter Code

Udacity has supplied the following:

1. An API. The API is provided in the form of a binary held in the bin folder. You never need to open the binary file, as there are no edits you can make to it. Your work will be 100% in the front end.

2. HTML Views. The focus of this course is not UI development or styling practice, so we have already provided you with pieces of UI, all you have to do is call them at the right times.

## Project Goals

1. Perform game functionality with async/await 

2. Fetch from provided API using API calls

## Getting Started

In order to build this game, we need to run two things: the game engine API and the front end.

### Start the Server

The game engine has been compiled down to a binary so that you can run it on any system. Because of this, you cannot edit the API in any way, it is just a black box that we interact with via the API endpoints.

To run the server, locate your operating system and run the associated command in your terminal at the root of the project.

| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |


### Start the Frontend

First, run `npm install && npm start` at the root of this project. Then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000.

## Project Requirements

This starter code base has directions for you in `src/client/assets/javascript/index.js`. There you will be directed to use certain asynchronous methods to achieve tasks. You will know you're making progress as you can play through more and more of the game.

### API Calls

API calls from the black box API provided by Udacity are required for the project.
The completed API calls are all at the bottom of the file: `src/client/assets/javascript/index.js`.
